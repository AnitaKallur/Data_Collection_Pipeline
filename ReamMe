Amazon Webscraping project:
This project is based on selenium to automate the web page. We need to import few modules to run smoothly.
After deciding on the website, we need to decide as to what exactly we need to scrape. I have scraped Best Selling Books on Amazon. So i get the links of the each listed book in the web page.
for fetching the links of each books, we need to go the the link and inspect to get the XPATH or ID etc write in the code.
We also need to nevigate and scroll the page as its a dynamic website, it gets loaded as you scroll. So i have used infinite scrolling or lazy loading to get the information.
